/**
 * Beam Checkout — the payment gateway replacing Stripe for workshop bookings.
 *
 * The exports deliberately mirror `lib/stripe.ts` one-for-one so the call sites
 * (bookings POST, /pay, /confirm, /expire, the cron sweep and
 * /api/payments/verify) change as little as possible:
 *
 *   createWorkshopCheckout  ← stripe.checkout.sessions.create
 *   disablePaymentLink      ← expireCheckoutSession  (kills a saved QR)
 *   fetchPaymentLink        ← fetchCheckoutSession   (redirect-time verify)
 *   refundCharge            ← refundPaymentIntent
 *   verifyBeamSignature     ← stripe.webhooks.constructEventAsync
 *
 * Beam is a plain REST API, so there is no SDK and none of the Workers
 * workarounds Stripe needed (no fetch httpClient, no SubtleCryptoProvider).
 *
 * MONEY UNIT — read before touching any amount here. Beam takes the smallest
 * currency unit: THB is satang, so ฿1 is 100 and a ฿2,500 workshop is 250000.
 * Verified 2026-08-21 against a live link — netAmount 100 rendered as ฿1 on the
 * hosted page. Getting this wrong is a silent 100x error in either direction,
 * which is why `toSatang` is the only conversion in the file and why every
 * request logs the baht and satang figures side by side.
